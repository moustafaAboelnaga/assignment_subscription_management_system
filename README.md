# Intro
My Name is Moustafa Aboelnaga , +8 experiene in Engineering field with techincal and managerail exprience , Worked on this task for around 4-5 hours , in this readme file I'll go through my mind when I implmented this task to answer all your expected future about my exprience and way of thinking when I'm trying to write code .

# Where to find the code?
On the same repo , branch master .


# How Did I think about this task?

First of all , I've a lot of helpers , Traits , Ready Basese Classes that facilite my work with symofny , with laravel , lumen and slim .
but I afraid of Over engineering the code , and i becames too complex however it's too simplte . that's why I prefered to write it with the minmiist code that require the functions to work properly as this task for evaluation my thinking way in code not the code itself.

# Architure Conflict ? 
Most of my tasks I prefer to work with ADR archutire specially with symofny , but I find this over the required , so I used the regular code flow of symofny .

# Architure unifing flow ?
I prefer always to unify one architure on the code level , but in this task I previewed muliple ways , like implmenting signup manullay , and using API Platform with Subscription module without controllers and presences .
so it will be different when it comes to a real new or exisiting proejct . if it's new I'll follow the best optimial way in the architure in all Modules , but when it comes to an existing I'll be alligned with the exisiting one .

**As An Example :-**
 I used Base Class For validation Requests in controllers (EDR Validation Arctiure) , but used validation rules in models in other Modules  , if it's a real project for sure I'll use one way , but because of it's just a task I explored muliple ways for implmenting the same thing .

# Where to find the Docuemtnation?
You can find it [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2442334/2s93sXbEGF#1775ebfb-fcad-4281-962a-27d953a6343d) 

# Why Documentaiton with Postman no Swaugger ?
I always prefer postman , as it give us a more space for writinh the testing on each endpoint , has a wonderful contrbuitions features specailly while we're work with as a team .

# what you think you missed in this task ?
if I have enought time( from my side ) , I'll do the following
1. write Phpunit testing .
2. write postman unit testing .
3. Decorize the project .
4. wirting more detailed documentation .
